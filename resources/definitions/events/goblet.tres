description = "A black-glass goblet is resting on a stone pedestal, its surface pulsing with a faint crimson glow. As you draw near, a whisper curls through the air like smoke: “One sip, and strength beyond mortal limits will be yours.” The liquid inside swirls of its own accord, releasing a sweet, metallic scent that tugs at something primal in your veins. The goblet tilts slightly toward you, as if eager for your lips, while a chill settles over the clearing and your allies shift uneasily in the shadows."
